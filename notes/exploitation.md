# Exploitation (conceptual, no PoC)

- Vulnerability class: Unauthenticated arbitrary file upload / Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- Conceptual exploitation steps:
  1. Identify upload endpoint or vulnerable plugin handler.
  2. Use a safe testing script to attempt file upload to controlled test instance.
  3. Confirm webshell presence via HTTP (sanitized: do not expose URLs).
  4. Use the webshell to execute benign commands to confirm execution (e.g., `id`, `pwd`).
  5. From the webshell, initiate a reverse shell to a listener inside an isolated lab.

- **Important:** No exploit payloads, webshells or exact commands are included in this repository. The goal is to teach methodology while avoiding providing direct exploit code.
